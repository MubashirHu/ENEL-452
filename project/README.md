An Elevator Control System consists of:
1. Up and Down Buttons at each Floor as well as a current floor indicator.
2. Inside the elevator, each floor is listed, open and close doors and an emergency button.
To get a better understanding of the requirements for the intersection controller it is best to observe
a live elevator and then model its behaviour.
Console components:
1. A status window that would inlude which floor the elevator is on.
2. CLI that includes commands like:
• Simulate user events at each floor.
• Simulate user events inside the elevator.
• Put the elevator in maintenance mode.
3. An external button that could indicate Stop.
